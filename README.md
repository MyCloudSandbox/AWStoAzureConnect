This Configuration establishes a secure and functional hybrid cloud environment between AWS and Azure. In AWS, it creates a VPC with two subnets, an internet gateway, a route table, and associates the route table with one of the subnets. It also sets up customer gateways, a VPN gateway, and VPN connections to facilitate secure communication with Azure. In Azure, it creates a resource group, a virtual network with subnets, and public IP addresses. It then configures a virtual network gateway and local network gateways to connect to the AWS VPN gateways. The configuration includes VPN gateway connections with pre-shared keys to ensure secure IPsec tunnels between the AWS and Azure environments. This setup allows seamless and secure connectivity between resources in AWS and Azure, enabling a robust hybrid cloud infrastructure.
